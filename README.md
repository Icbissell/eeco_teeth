######## ELIZABETH TO UPDATE FILE NUMBERS AT THE END OF THIS #############
The workflow for replicating analyses is as follows: 
1) Run the age_models.R script to generate appropriate ages for the samples. 

f_figures.R: produces all plots to include in main manuscript

f_scatter.R: produces scatter plot and tests the significant of the correlation between IAR and $\delta^{18}O$

f_compute_length.R: computes lengths, average lengths for time periods, and combines morphotype dataset with length dataset to make teeth_total.csv and length_means.csv files.
